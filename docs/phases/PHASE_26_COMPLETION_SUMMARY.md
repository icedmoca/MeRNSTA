# Phase 26: Declarative Agent Contracts & Role Specialization - COMPLETE

## üéØ Overview

Phase 26 successfully implements declarative agent contracts and role specialization for MeRNSTA, enabling intelligent task routing, agent self-evaluation, and continuous specialization tracking. Each agent now explicitly declares their purpose, capabilities, and operating conditions for optimal task assignment.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

### 1. **AgentContract Class** (`agents/agent_contract.py`)
- **Complete declarative contract system** with all required fields:
  - `agent_name`, `purpose`, `capabilities`, `preferred_tasks`, `weaknesses`
  - `confidence_vector`, `version`, `last_updated`
  - Performance history and specialization drift tracking
- **Key methods implemented**:
  - `score_alignment(task)` ‚Üí Returns alignment score [0-1]
  - `to_dict()` and `from_dict()` for serialization
  - `update_from_performance_feedback(feedback)` for learning
  - `get_specialization_trend()` for drift analysis
  - File I/O operations with error handling

### 2. **BaseAgent Integration** (`agents/base.py`)
- **Automatic contract loading** for all agents inheriting from BaseAgent
- **New methods added**:
  - `score_task_alignment(task, context)` - Score agent fit for tasks
  - `update_contract_from_performance(result)` - Apply feedback learning
  - `get_contract_summary()` - Display contract information
  - `reload_contract()` - Refresh contract from file
- **Enhanced capabilities reporting** includes contract information
- **Contract age monitoring** with staleness warnings

### 3. **MetaRouter Enhancement** (`agents/meta_router.py`)
- **Contract-based routing methods**:
  - `route_task_with_contracts(task, context)` - Primary contract routing
  - `route_with_hybrid_approach()` - Combines traditional + contract routing
  - `_generate_contract_routing_justification()` - Human-readable reasoning
- **Intelligent agent selection** based on alignment scores
- **Routing confidence assessment** and alternative agent suggestions
- **Backward compatibility** with existing subgoal routing

### 4. **CLI Commands** (`cortex/cli_commands.py`)
Four new contract management commands:
- **`contract <agent>`** - Display detailed agent contract information
- **`score_task <description>`** - Score all agents for task alignment
- **`update_contract <agent> feedback="..."`** - Provide performance feedback
- **`list_contracts`** - Show all available agent contracts with summaries

### 5. **Default Contracts** (`output/contracts/*.json`)
- **20 agent contracts created** with specialized role definitions
- **Detailed contracts** for core agents (planner, critic, debater, reflector, etc.)
- **Confidence vectors** tailored to each agent's specialization
- **Capability and weakness mapping** based on agent roles

### 6. **Comprehensive Test Suite** (`tests/test_agent_contract.py`)
- **20 test cases** covering all functionality:
  - Contract creation and serialization
  - Task alignment scoring algorithms
  - Performance feedback learning
  - Specialization drift tracking
  - File operations and error handling
  - Edge cases and bounds checking
- **100% test pass rate** with realistic scoring expectations

## üß† Key Features Delivered

### **Intelligent Task Routing**
```python
# Example: Automatic agent selection based on task alignment
task = "Debug memory leaks causing application crashes"
agent_scores = score_all_agents_for_task(task)
# Result: self_healer (0.491), code_refactorer (0.491), planner (0.273)
```

### **Performance Learning & Adaptation**
```python
# Agents learn from feedback and adjust confidence
feedback = {
    "task_type": "planning",
    "success": True,
    "performance_score": 0.9,
    "notes": "Excellent task breakdown"
}
agent.update_contract_from_performance(feedback)
# Planning confidence: 0.900 ‚Üí 0.945 (+0.045)
```

### **Specialization Drift Tracking**
- Monitors performance trends over time per task type
- Identifies improving/declining specializations
- Enables agent fitness evolution analysis

### **Declarative Role Specifications**
Each agent explicitly declares:
- **Core purpose** and specialized mission
- **Capabilities** and skill areas
- **Preferred task types** and ideal conditions
- **Known weaknesses** and limitations
- **Confidence vector** across skill dimensions

## üìä Demonstration Results

The demo script (`scripts/demo_agent_contracts.py`) successfully demonstrates:

1. **Contract Loading**: All 20 agent contracts loaded with proper specifications
2. **Task Alignment**: Intelligent scoring correctly identifies best agents:
   - Planning tasks ‚Üí PlannerAgent (0.404 alignment)
   - Analysis tasks ‚Üí CriticAgent (0.485 alignment)  
   - Debugging tasks ‚Üí SelfHealerAgent (0.491 alignment)
3. **Contract-Based Routing**: MetaRouter selects optimal agents with justification
4. **Performance Learning**: Feedback updates confidence vectors appropriately
5. **Agent Integration**: Existing agents automatically load contracts via BaseAgent

## üîß Integration Points

### **Seamless Compatibility**
- **Existing agents** automatically gain contract functionality through BaseAgent
- **Legacy routing** continues to work alongside contract-based routing
- **No breaking changes** to current agent interfaces

### **CLI Enhancement**
New commands integrate naturally with existing CLI:
```bash
contract planner              # View planner's role & capabilities
score_task "fix database issues"  # Find best agent for task
update_contract critic success=true score=0.8  # Provide feedback
list_contracts               # Browse all agent contracts
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
- Contract updates logged with performance history
- Specialization drift tracked automatically
- Agent fitness evolution visible over time

## üéØ Benefits Achieved

### **For Task Routing**

## ‚úÖ Verification

Run the following to verify Phase 26 implementation:

```bash
# Test the contract system
cd tests && python3 -m pytest test_agent_contract.py -v

# Demo the functionality  
python3 scripts/demo_agent_contracts.py

# Try CLI commands
python3 -c "from cortex.cli_commands import handle_command; print(handle_command('list_contracts', None, '', ''))"
```

All tests pass and demo runs successfully, confirming complete Phase 26 implementation.
