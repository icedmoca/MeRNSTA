# Phase 33: Neural Control Hooks (Reflex ‚Üî Deliberative Arbitration) - Implementation Summary

## üß† Overview

Phase 33 introduces a dynamic arbitration system between reflex and deep reasoning systems, based on context, dissonance, and emotion state. This creates cognitive feedback loops like a nervous system, providing neural control hooks that route decisions to the most appropriate cognitive agent.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CognitiveArbiter** (`agents/cognitive_arbiter.py`)
   - Main orchestrator for cognitive routing decisions
   - Analyzes multiple input factors to choose optimal cognitive mode
   - Provides complete audit trails and performance tracking

2. **Cognitive Hooks** (`agents/cognitive_hooks.py`) 
   - Integration points throughout the system
   - Decorator pattern for easy addition to functions
   - Multiple hook types for different decision contexts

3. **CLI Integration** (`cortex/cli_commands.py`)
   - `/arbiter_trace` command for decision history analysis
   - Detailed performance metrics and reasoning chains

4. **Configuration** (`config.yaml`)
   - Fully configurable thresholds and weights
   - No hard-coded values (per user's memory preference)

## üéØ Key Features

### Dynamic Agent Selection
- **FastReflexAgent**: Quick, intuitive responses for routine tasks
- **PlannerAgent**: Structured analysis for complex problems  
- **MetaSelfAgent**: Deep reasoning for high-stakes decisions

### Multi-Factor Arbitration Inputs
- **Dissonance Pressure**: From existing DissonanceTracker system
- **Confidence Score**: Calculated from multiple sources
- **Time Budget**: Available processing time
- **Trait Profile**: Personality-based factors (caution, emotional_sensitivity)
- **Task Complexity**: Estimated from message analysis
- **Cognitive Load**: Current system load assessment

### Neural Feedback System
- Performance tracking and learning
- Adaptive weight adjustments based on success rates
- Backup mode selection for failure scenarios
- Risk assessment for each decision

## üìä Arbitration Logic

### Scoring Algorithm
```python
mode_scores = {
    FastReflex: base_score + time_pressure_bonus - complexity_penalty,
    Planner: base_score + complexity_bonus + analytical_trait_bonus,
    MetaSelf: base_score + dissonance_bonus + caution_trait_bonus
}
```

### Decision Factors
1. **High Dissonance** (>0.7) ‚Üí Favors MetaSelf for conflict resolution
2. **Low Confidence** (<0.4) ‚Üí Avoids FastReflex, prefers deeper analysis
3. **Time Pressure** (<10s) ‚Üí Strongly favors FastReflex
4. **High Complexity** (>0.8) ‚Üí Favors Planner or MetaSelf
5. **Trait Influences** ‚Üí Caution, emotional sensitivity, analytical preference

### Reasoning Chain Generation
Each decision includes step-by-step reasoning:
- Input factor assessment
- Key decision drivers  
- Trait influences
- Mode scoring summary
- Final selection rationale

## üîß Integration Points

### Main Cognitive Loop
- Integrated into `Phase2AutonomousCognitiveSystem.process_input_with_full_cognition`
- Routes all non-command inputs through arbitration
- Fallback to original processing if arbitration fails

### Hook Types Available
- `agent_loop_hook`: Main agent processing
- `planner_hook`: Planning system decisions  
- `meta_decision_hook`: High-level cognitive decisions
- `response_generation_hook`: User-facing responses
- `problem_solving_hook`: Complex problem analysis
- `error_handling_hook`: Error recovery decisions
- `learning_hook`: Learning and adaptation

### Decorator Pattern
```python
@with_cognitive_arbitration('planning')
def my_planning_function(message, context=None):
    return original_logic(message, context)
```

## üìà Audit and Tracing

### Complete Decision Trails
Each arbitration decision logs:
- **Decision ID**: Unique identifier
- **Timestamp**: When decision was made
- **Chosen Mode**: Selected cognitive agent
- **Primary Reason**: Main factor driving decision
- **Confidence**: Decision confidence score
- **Input Factors**: All arbitration inputs
- **Reasoning Chain**: Step-by-step logic
- **Execution Results**: Performance metrics
- **Success Status**: Whether execution succeeded

### CLI Tracing
```bash
/arbiter_trace [limit]
```
Shows:
- Recent arbitration decisions with full context
- Performance summary by cognitive mode
- Success rates and timing statistics
- Detailed reasoning for each decision

### Performance Analytics
