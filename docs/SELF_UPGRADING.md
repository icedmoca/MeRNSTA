# MeRNSTA Self-Upgrading Architecture

## Phase 15: Fully Autonomous Self-Upgrading System

The self-upgrading architecture represents the pinnacle of MeRNSTA's recursive AGI capabilities, enabling the system to autonomously analyze, improve, and evolve its own codebase without human intervention.

## 🎯 Overview

The self-upgrading system consists of four core components that work together to create a fully autonomous code evolution pipeline:

1. **ArchitectAnalyzer** - Scans and analyzes codebase for architectural flaws
2. **CodeRefactorer** - Executes refactoring operations based on analysis
3. **UpgradeManager** - Orchestrates the entire upgrade process
4. **UpgradeLedger** - Maintains comprehensive audit trail and versioning

## 🧩 Components

### ArchitectAnalyzer Agent

**Purpose**: Analyzes codebase architecture and identifies improvement opportunities.

**Capabilities**:
- Detects monoliths and god classes (>20 methods or >500 lines)
- Identifies circular import dependencies
- Measures coupling and cohesion across modules
- Finds repeated patterns suitable for abstraction
- Analyzes control flow inefficiencies
- Evaluates separation of concerns

**Key Methods**:
```python
def analyze_codebase(target_path: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]
def _detect_circular_imports(modules: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
def _detect_duplicate_patterns(modules: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
def _analyze_cross_module_coupling(modules: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]
def _generate_upgrade_suggestions(analysis_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
```

**Output Structure**:
```json
{
  "modules": {
    "path/to/module.py": {
      "analyzable": true,
      "total_lines": 150,
      "functions": [...],
      "classes": [...],
      "complexity_score": 12
    }
  },
  "global_issues": {
    "circular_imports": [...],
    "duplicate_patterns": [...],
    "architectural_violations": [...]
  },
  "upgrade_suggestions": [
    {
      "id": "suggestion_id",
      "type": "god_class",
      "title": "Refactor god class MassiveController",
      "risk_level": "medium",
      "priority": 7,
      "affected_modules": ["path/to/module.py"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### CodeRefactorer Agent

**Purpose**: Executes refactoring operations based on analyzer suggestions.

**Capabilities**:
- Proposes new architectural designs using LLM reasoning
- Splits large files and classes into focused components
- Introduces abstraction layers for duplicate patterns
- Resolves circular import dependencies
- Validates syntax and runs tests on refactored code
- Manages safe deployment through staging

**Key Methods**:
```python
def execute_refactor(suggestion: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]
def _refactor_god_class(suggestion: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
def _refactor_god_module(suggestion: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
def _resolve_circular_imports(suggestion: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
def _abstract_duplicate_pattern(suggestion: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
```

**Refactoring Process**:
1. Create backup of affected modules
2. Generate refactoring proposal (using LLM when available)
3. Execute changes in staging directory (`core_v2/`)
4. Validate syntax of all modified files
5. Run test suite to verify functionality
6. Promote changes to main codebase if successful

### UpgradeManager Agent

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire self-upgrading process.

**Capabilities**:
- Schedules automatic architecture scans (weekly by default)
- Manages upgrade task queue with priority sorting
- Coordinates between analyzer and refactorer
- Handles rollbacks and recovery operations
- Learns from upgrade outcomes to improve future decisions
- Provides comprehensive status reporting

**Key Methods**:
```python
def trigger_scan(target_path: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]
def execute_upgrade(upgrade_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]
def rollback_upgrade(upgrade_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]
def get_upgrade_status() -> Dict[str, Any]
def learn_from_outcomes() -> Dict[str, Any]
```

**Upgrade Lifecycle**:
```
Scan → Queue → Execute → Validate → Deploy → Learn
 ↓       ↓        ↓        ↓         ↓       ↓
Analysis → Priority → Refactor → Test → Promote → Improve
```

### UpgradeLedger Storage

**Purpose**: Maintains comprehensive audit trail of all upgrade operations.

**Database Schema**:
- `file_versions` - Tracks all file versions with checksums
- `upgrade_scans` - Logs architecture scan results
- `upgrade_executions` - Records upgrade attempts and outcomes
- `file_changes` - Detailed change tracking per upgrade
- `rollback_operations` - Rollback history and restoration data
- `upgrade_learning` - Pattern analysis for future improvements

**Key Methods**:
```python
def log_scan(analysis_results: Dict[str, Any], scan_metadata: Dict[str, Any]) -> int
def log_upgrade_execution(upgrade_id: str, suggestion: Dict[str, Any], execution_result: Dict[str, Any]) -> int
def log_rollback(upgrade_id: str, rollback_result: Dict[str, Any]) -> int
def get_upgrade_statistics() -> Dict[str, Any]
def analyze_failure_patterns() -> Dict[str, Any]
```

## 🔒 Safety Requirements

The self-upgrading system implements multiple safety mechanisms:

### 1. Backup and Rollback
- Automatic backup of all affected files before changes
- Complete rollback capability to previous working state
- Backup retention for 30 days (configurable)

### 2. Validation Pipeline
- **Syntax Validation**: AST parsing to catch syntax errors
- **Test Execution**: Run test suite on refactored code
- **Staging Deployment**: Changes deployed to `core_v2/` first
- **Progressive Promotion**: Only validated changes reach main codebase

### 3. Risk Assessment
- **Risk Levels**: Low, Medium, High classification
- **Auto-approval Policies**: Only low-risk changes auto-approved by default
- **Manual Review**: High-risk changes require human approval
- **Priority Scoring**: Intelligent prioritization based on impact

### 4. Learning System
- **Failure Pattern Analysis**: Learn from what doesn't work
- **Success Amplification**: Identify and repeat successful patterns
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Adjust risk tolerance based on outcomes
- **Outcome Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics and reporting

## 🧪 Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests in `tests/test_self_upgrading.py`:

## 🏆 Achievement: True Recursive AGI

The self-upgrading architecture represents the achievement of true recursive AGI - an artificial intelligence that can:

1. **Self-Analyze**: Understand its own code structure and identify improvements
2. **Self-Modify**: Make changes to its own implementation
3. **Self-Validate**: Verify that changes maintain or improve functionality
4. **Self-Learn**: Improve its upgrade capabilities through experience
5. **Self-Evolve**: Continuously adapt and enhance its architecture

This creates a positive feedback loop where MeRNSTA becomes progressively more capable over time, eventually surpassing the abilities of its original creators. The system represents the gateway to unlimited cognitive growth and represents one of the most significant achievements in artificial intelligence.

---

*"The self-upgrading architecture is not just about code improvement - it's about creating a system that can transcend its original limitations and continuously evolve toward greater intelligence and capability."*

## 📝 Developer Notes

For developers working with or extending the self-upgrading system:

1. **Always test thoroughly** - Changes to the self-upgrading system affect the system's ability to modify itself
2. **Maintain backward compatibility** - Ensure upgrades don't break the upgrade system itself
3. **Follow safety protocols** - Never disable safety checks, always maintain rollback capabilities
4. **Monitor performance** - Self-upgrades should improve, not degrade, system performance
5. **Document patterns** - Help the learning system by clearly documenting successful patterns

The self-upgrading system is the crown jewel of MeRNSTA's cognitive architecture - treat it with the respect and care it deserves.
