## How Recursive Planning Works

### 1. Goal Analysis Phase

When a goal is received, the RecursivePlanner:

1. **Analyzes Complexity**: Determines if the goal requires decomposition
2. **Checks for Similar Plans**: Searches plan memory for reusable approaches
3. **Gathers Context**: Collects relevant memory, reflections, and system state
4. **Records Intention**: Documents why this goal was created

### 2. Plan Generation Phase

The planner generates a structured plan by:

1. **LLM-Assisted Decomposition**: Uses language models to break down complex goals
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Identifies prerequisites and resource requirements
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates potential obstacles and mitigation strategies
4. **Success Criteria Definition**: Establishes measurable completion criteria

### 3. Recursive Decomposition

For complex steps, the system:

1. **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluates step complexity using heuristics
2. **Sub-Plan Generation**: Creates detailed plans for complex steps
3. **Depth Management**: Respects maximum recursion limits
4. **Cross-Reference Storage**: Links sub-plans to parent plans

### 4. Plan Scoring and Optimization

Generated plans are evaluated on:

- **Step Quality** (40%): Clarity, specificity, and actionability
- **Plan Coherence** (30%): Logical flow and dependency alignment
- **Feasibility** (20%): Realistic expectations and resource availability
- **Intention Clarity** (10%): Clear reasoning for each step

### 5. Execution and Learning

During execution:

1. **Progressive Execution**: Steps executed in dependency order
2. **Prerequisite Validation**: Ensures dependencies are satisfied
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates and logging
4. **Outcome Recording**: Captures results for future learning

## Intention Chain Formation

### How Intention Chains Work

Intention chains trace the causal relationships between goals:

```
Root Cause → Intermediate Goal → Specific Action → Implementation Detail
```

**Example Chain:**
```
User Complaint about Speed → Improve Performance → Optimize Memory → Cache Efficiency
```

### Recording Intentions

Every goal gets an intention record containing:

- **Triggered By**: What caused this goal to be created
- **Drive Category**: Psychological/functional motivation (e.g., efficiency, learning, problem-solving)
- **Importance Score**: Relative priority and urgency
- **Reflection Note**: Human-readable explanation
- **Parent Relationships**: Links to causing goals

### Drives and Motivations

The system recognizes these drive categories:

- **Self-Improvement**: Enhancing capabilities and performance
- **Problem-Solving**: Addressing specific issues or obstacles
- **Curiosity**: Exploring new areas or understanding phenomena
- **Efficiency**: Optimizing resource usage and speed
- **Learning**: Acquiring new knowledge or skills
- **Creativity**: Generating novel solutions or approaches
- **Social**: Improving user interaction and satisfaction
- **Maintenance**: Keeping systems healthy and functional
- **Exploration**: Investigating uncharted territories
- **Achievement**: Completing objectives and reaching targets

## Self-Directed Goal Generation

The SelfPromptGenerator analyzes multiple data sources:

1. **Memory System**:
   - Contradiction patterns and resolution success rates
   - Fact volatility and instability trends
   - Knowledge gaps and coverage areas

2. **Plan Performance**:
   - Success/failure rates by plan type and complexity
   - Common failure patterns and their causes
   - Resource utilization and efficiency metrics

3. **Intention Patterns**:
   - Motivational drive distributions
   - Goal fulfillment rates by category
   - Intention chain depth and complexity

4. **Reflection Insights**:
   - Recent discoveries and pattern recognition
   - Self-analysis results and recommendations
   - Contradiction resolution outcomes

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Memory System Integration

The recursive planning system integrates with MeRNSTA's memory systems:

```python
# In memory.append() - automatically record intentions
from storage.intention_model import record_goal_intention

def append_with_intention(fact, goal_context=None):
    # Store the fact normally
    fact_id = self.append(fact)
    
    # Record intention if goal context provided
    if goal_context:
        record_goal_intention(
            goal_id=goal_context['goal_id'],
            why=goal_context['reasoning'],
            drive=goal_context.get('drive', 'knowledge_acquisition'),
            importance=goal_context.get('importance', 0.5)
        )
    
    return fact_id
```

### Agent Loop Integration

The recursive planner integrates into the main agent loop:

```python
# Enhanced agent processing
def process_user_input(user_input, context):
    # Check if input looks like a goal/request for planning
    if is_goal_request(user_input):
        planner = RecursivePlanner()
        plan = planner.plan_goal(user_input, context=context)
        
        # Optionally execute immediately or present for approval
        if context.get('auto_execute', False):
            results = planner.execute_plan(plan)
            return format_execution_results(results)
        else:
            return format_plan_presentation(plan)
    
    # Continue with normal processing
    return normal_agent_processing(user_input, context)
```

### Autonomous Operation

The system can operate autonomously:

```python
# Periodic self-improvement
def autonomous_improvement_cycle():
    self_prompter = SelfPromptGenerator()
    planner = RecursivePlanner()
    
    # Generate self-directed goals
    goals = self_prompter.propose_goals()
    prioritized = self_prompter.prioritize_goals(goals)
    
    # Create and execute plans for top priority goals
    for goal in prioritized[:3]:  # Top 3 goals
        plan = planner.plan_goal(goal)
        if planner.score_plan(plan) > 0.7:  # High confidence
            results = planner.execute_plan(plan)
            log_autonomous_improvement(goal, plan, results)
```

## Advanced Features

### Plan Templates and Patterns

```python
# Example learned pattern
{
    "pattern_name": "optimization_workflow",
    "triggers": ["optimize", "improve", "enhance"],
    "template_steps": [
        "Analyze current state and identify bottlenecks",
        "Research optimization opportunities", 
        "Implement highest-impact improvements",

# Multi-agent plan generation
def collaborative_plan(goal_text):
    planner = RecursivePlanner()
    critic = CriticAgent()
    debater = DebaterAgent()
    
    # Generate initial plan
    initial_plan = planner.plan_goal(goal_text)
    
    # Get criticism and improvements
    critiques = critic.evaluate_plan(initial_plan)
    alternatives = debater.propose_alternatives(initial_plan)
    
    # Refine plan based on feedback
    refined_plan = planner.refine_plan(initial_plan, critiques, alternatives)
    
    return refined_plan
```

## Best Practices

### Plan Design Guidelines

1. **Clear, Actionable Steps**: Each step should be specific and executable
2. **Logical Dependencies**: Prerequisites should be clear and well-ordered
3. **Measurable Outcomes**: Expected results should be verifiable
4. **Resource Awareness**: Consider what's needed for each step
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Identify potential obstacles and alternatives

### Intention Recording Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Clear reasoning for why goals exist
2. **Chain Appropriately**: Link related goals to maintain causality
3. **Categorize Drives**: Use consistent drive categories for pattern recognition
4. **Update Status**: Keep intention status current (fulfilled/abandoned)
5. **Add Reflections**: Include insights gained during goal pursuit

### Self-Prompting Guidelines

1. **Regular Analysis**: Run self-prompting periodically to catch issues early
2. **Balance Goal Types**: Mix improvement, exploration, and maintenance goals
3. **Prioritize Impact**: Focus on high-impact, feasible improvements
4. **Learn from Patterns**: Use past successes and failures to guide generation
5. **Monitor Execution**: Track self-generated goal outcomes for feedback

### Integration Considerations

1. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with manual planning, gradually increase autonomy
2. **User Control**: Always allow user override of autonomous decisions
3. **Transparency**: Make intention chains and reasoning visible to users
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track system performance to ensure improvements
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Maintain backup approaches when planning fails

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Plans generated are too vague or generic
**Solution**: Improve context gathering, use more specific prompting, enhance LLM instructions

**Issue**: Plan execution fails frequently
**Solution**: Improve step feasibility assessment, better prerequisite checking, enhanced error handling

**Issue**: Intention chains are shallow or unclear
**Solution**: Better drive categorization, more detailed reflection notes, improved chain linking

**Issue**: Self-generated goals are not relevant
**Solution**: Enhance analysis data gathering, tune goal patterns, improve prioritization weights

**Issue**: Database performance degrades over time
**Solution**: Implement data archiving, optimize database indices, clean up old plans/intentions

### Performance Optimization

1. **Database Tuning**: Ensure proper indexing on frequently queried fields
2. **Embedding Caching**: Cache goal embeddings for faster similarity searches
3. **Plan Pruning**: Archive or delete old, unused plans periodically
4. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple goals together when possible
5. **Lazy Loading**: Load plan details only when needed for display

### Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Success Rate Tracking**: Monitor plan execution success rates
2. **Performance Metrics**: Track planning time, execution time, resource usage
3. **User Satisfaction**: Gather feedback on plan quality and usefulness
4. **System Health**: Monitor database performance and storage usage
5. **Learning Progress**: Track improvement in plan quality over time

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Multi-Modal Planning**: Support for plans involving different data types (text, images, code)
2. **Collaborative Planning**: Multiple agents contributing to plan creation
3. **Dynamic Replanning**: Real-time plan adaptation based on execution feedback
4. **Cross-Domain Learning**: Apply successful patterns across different problem domains
5. **Explanation Generation**: Automatic generation of plan explanations for users

### Research Directions

1. **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Use RL to optimize plan generation and execution
2. **Causal Reasoning Enhancement**: More sophisticated causal chain inference
3. **Natural Language Plan Execution**: Direct execution of plans described in natural language
4. **Meta-Planning**: Plans for how to create better plans
5. **Distributed Planning**: Coordinate planning across multiple MeRNSTA instances
