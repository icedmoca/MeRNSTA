Predictive Chat Preemption System for MeRNSTA

This system proactively responds in the chat UI with helpful suggestions when
prediction models forecast likely emotional or behavioral states.

ðŸ“Œ DO NOT HARDCODE trigger thresholds or message templates.
All parameters must be loaded from `config.settings` or environment config.
This is a zero-hardcoding cognitive subsystem.
